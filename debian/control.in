Description: Help a new user get started in GNOME
 GNOME getting started docs contains a intuitive 'Getting
 Started' guide (with video guides), that can be viewed with Yelp. It is
 normally used together with gnome-initial-setup, but is also very useful
 as tutorial and 'users guide' for new (or not experienced) users.
